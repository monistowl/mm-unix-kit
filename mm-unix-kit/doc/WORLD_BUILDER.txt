 Materia Mundi — World Builder’s Guide
=====================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide shows how to create a new campaign world or adapt an existing
setting to the UNIX Materia Mundi framework.  It assumes you already
understand the basics of sessions, characters, and logs.

Everything here can be done with a text editor and a few shell commands.
No scripting or compiling is required.


THE PHILOSOPHY
--------------
Each world is a self-contained directory tree:
    campaign/<WorldName>/
        pcs/         → player characters
        npcs/        → referee secrets
        maps/        → ascii maps
        stash/       → handouts, relics, props
        lib/         → local rule tables (optional)
        sessions/    → one subdirectory per session
        README.md    → overview & lore
        SESSION_ZERO.txt
        REFEREE_QUICKSTART.txt

You can have many worlds on one server.  Each one uses the same tools.


CREATE A NEW WORLD
------------------
1.  Copy an existing campaign as a template:
        cd /games/mm/campaign
        cp -r Antwerp-HYW MyNewWorld
        rm -rf MyNewWorld/sessions/*
        rm -f  MyNewWorld/pcs/*.mm
        echo "Materia Mundi — My New World" > MyNewWorld/README.md

2.  Customize setting files:
        vi MyNewWorld/README.md
        vi MyNewWorld/SESSION_ZERO.txt
        vi MyNewWorld/REFEREE_QUICKSTART.txt

3.  Test it:
        mm-session start MyNewWorld 1
        export MM_SESSION=.../MyNewWorld/sessions/<date>_1
        mm-say "New world online!"

You now have a new playable universe.


SETTING DESIGN
--------------
Keep it grounded, not encyclopedic.
Each world should have:
  •  A historical or mythic spine  (when & where)
  •  A metaphysical thesis         (what is "Materia" here?)
  •  Three major factions or powers
  •  Three frontier regions worth exploring
  •  A tone palette (grim, wondrous, comedic, tragic...)

A one-page README is enough.  Players discover details through play.


RULE VARIANTS
-------------
You may include a per-world rule directory:
    campaign/<world>/lib/rules/

Overrides load naturally; point mm-* scripts there by setting:

    export MM_ROOT=/games/mm/campaign/<world>

Examples:
  •  Different save thresholds
  •  Custom skill tables
  •  New weapon types

Keep format consistent with the main TSVs for portability.


MAP MAKING
----------
ASCII maps are the heart of the system.
Each map is just a text file with a header:

    @ legend: #=wall .=floor D=door ~=water
    @ size: 40x20
    ########################################
    #..D....#####....#.....................#
    #........#..#....#........#####........#
    ########################################

Tips:
  •  Use fixed width fonts.
  •  Keep ≤80 columns for terminal fit.
  •  Save under  campaign/<world>/maps/
  •  Load during play:  mm-map set maps/dungeon1.txt
  •  Edit live:  mm-map edit

Dynamic mapping ideas:
  •  Store “fog of war” by copying map.txt → map_player.txt and erasing sections.
  •  Use comments (#@) for GM-only features.


CREATING RANDOM TABLES
----------------------
Tables use simple tab-separated format:
    weight<TAB>result

Example:  lib/tables/forest_encounters.tsv
    3   2d6 wolves
    2   bandits (Ld 0, 1d6+2)
    1   fae lights whisper “Go home”
    1   lost child with relic fragment

Usage:
    mm-table lib/tables/forest_encounters.tsv
    → outputs one result by weighted random choice.

Combine with mm-note:
    mm-note "Encounter: $(mm-table lib/tables/forest_encounters.tsv)"

You can nest tables by including other filenames in results.

Add subcategories for variety:
    lib/tables/weather.tsv
    lib/tables/omens.tsv
    lib/tables/treasures.tsv


REGIONAL STRUCTURE
------------------
For large worlds, mirror geography as subdirectories:
    campaign/MyWorld/maps/City/
    campaign/MyWorld/maps/Wilderness/
    campaign/MyWorld/tables/CityEvents/
    campaign/MyWorld/stash/Lore/

Then use symbolic links for active regions:
    ln -s maps/City/guildhall.txt map.txt

This lets you “move” the party by changing symlinks.


NARRATIVE SEEDS
---------------
If you want reusable prompts, create  lore.txt  or  rumors.tsv.
Rumors table example:
    3   “The duke’s astrologer vanished beneath the tower.”
    1   “They say a saint walks the river when it freezes.”

Run:  mm-table lib/tables/rumors.tsv  to inspire a scene.


MULTI-REFEREE WORLDS
--------------------
Multiple refs can share a campaign:
  •  Assign each one to group mmref.
  •  Mark gm.log lines with initials.
  •  Alternate running sessions by date.
  •  Maintain a shared world bible under  /world-notes/

Keep tone consistent by writing short post-session summaries:
    mm-note "Summary: The bandits allied with the hermit."


IN-UNIVERSE WRITING
-------------------
Encourage players to leave documents in-world:
  •  stash/letters/
  •  stash/maps/ (hand-drawn ASCII)
  •  stash/journals/

These can be referenced in later sessions or shared publicly.
A living world grows through its text artifacts.


ADVANCED IDEAS
--------------
•  Procedural generation:  combine mm-table + shell loops
      for i in $(seq 1 5); do mm-table lib/tables/treasures.tsv; done

•  “Dynamic weather” script in cron to rewrite a file daily.

•  “World time” via timestamped note in gm.log each session start.

•  Connect worlds:  soft-link characters across campaigns.

•  Public archives:  git repo for pcs/ and logs (write-protected).


DESIGN ETHOS
------------
Materia Mundi worlds are not software projects.
They are *ritual documents*—logs of shared imagination.

Favor clarity over detail.
Leave mysteries unsolved.
Make the next referee curious.


MINIMAL TEMPLATE RECAP
----------------------
To build from scratch:

    mkdir -p /games/mm/campaign/MyWorld/{pcs,npcs,maps,stash,sessions}
    cp /games/mm/lib/templates/character.mm /games/mm/campaign/MyWorld/pcs/
    echo "Materia Mundi — MyWorld" > /games/mm/campaign/MyWorld/README.md
    echo "SessionZero coming soon" > /games/mm/campaign/MyWorld/SESSION_ZERO.txt
    echo "RefQuickstart coming soon" > /games/mm/campaign/MyWorld/REFEREE_QUICKSTART.txt

Then test:
    mm-session start MyWorld 1
    mm-say "First light over a new world."
