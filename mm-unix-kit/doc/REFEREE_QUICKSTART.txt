Materia Mundi — Referee Quickstart
==================================

ROLE OF THE REFEREE
-------------------
You are the world: its weather, people, laws, and mysteries.

Players control individuals within it.  You describe what they perceive,
decide what happens when they act, and embody every creature they meet.

You are also the system’s caretaker—maintaining directories, permissions,
and the rhythm of play.

Think of yourself as a conductor and archivist rather than a judge.


REFEREE CHECKLIST
-----------------
Before Session 1:
  [ ]  Create or verify a campaign directory under /games/mm/campaign/.
  [ ]  Read SESSION_ZERO.txt aloud or summarize it.
  [ ]  Make sure everyone has user accounts and correct group membership.
  [ ]  Build the dice roller:  cd /games/mm && make
  [ ]  Start a session:
          mm-session start Antwerp-HYW 1
          export MM_SESSION=.../sessions/<date>_1
  [ ]  If using tmux:  mm-tmux-ref Antwerp-HYW gm
  [ ]  Check that  log.txt, gm.log, and rng.log  exist.

During play:
  [ ]  Keep log.txt visible in one pane.
  [ ]  Use gm.log for private notes or prep.
  [ ]  Use mm-note to mark scene transitions.
  [ ]  Use mm-map to edit or display maps.

After play:
  [ ]  mm-note "END OF SESSION"
  [ ]  tar czf ../sessions/<date>.tgz .
  [ ]  Optionally prune FIFOs, keep logs read-only.


ADJUDICATION STYLE
------------------
Rules are simple on purpose.  If you can’t find an exact rule, invent one
consistent with the fiction and record it in gm.log.

Difficulty
----------
Normal tasks: roll at listed skill (e.g. 5+ on 1d6)
Easy tasks:   mm-skill <N> easy
Hard tasks:   mm-skill <N> hard
Improbable:   require a Save or 2d6 test, not a skill.

Combat
------
1.  Use mm-initiative to order turns.
2.  Attacks:
        mm-attack melee +1 1     # STR+1, level 1 → returns target number
        mm-roll d20              # success if ≥ target
3.  Damage is whatever fits the weapon—use 1d6 or 1d8 for most.
4.  Enemies act when their initiative comes up; keep it fast.

Saves
-----
Call for saves when failure would be serious but survivable.
Use the ability most relevant to the threat:
  KD = Knockdown / Paralysis  (STR or CON)
  DP = Death / Poison         (CON)
  BR = Blast / Ray            (DEX)
  IC = Illusion / Confusion   (WIS)
  CB = Curse / Beguilement    (CHA)
  FD = Fear / Despair         (WIS or CHA)

Example:
    mm-save BR +1 1     → 13
    Player rolls d20.  A 13 or higher succeeds.

Skill Examples
--------------
Finesse   — pick locks, disarm traps
Perception— spot hidden doors, hear noises
Lore      — recall old stories, read inscriptions
Charm     — convince, negotiate, seduce
Wit       — improvise, think fast, outsmart

n-in-6 rolls keep the classic dungeon feel—low success means tension.

Movement & Maps
---------------
Every area is just text.  The simplest map uses ASCII:
    mm-map edit     # to draw
    mm-map show     # to display to players

Use coordinates in notes or pins:
    mm-map pin 12 7 “Secret door”
You can drop ready-made maps into lib/maps/ and copy them over.

Encounters & Tables
-------------------
Use TSV tables for fast improvisation.

Example:
    mm-table /games/mm/lib/tables/wilderness_encounters.tsv
You can make your own:
    echo -e "2\tmerchant caravan\n1\togre" > lib/tables/road.tsv
    mm-table lib/tables/road.tsv

To spawn an encounter:
    mm-note "Encounter: $(mm-table lib/tables/road.tsv)"

Pacing & Scene Transitions
--------------------------
A good session alternates tension and recovery.
Between each major event, change the tempo:
  •  Conversation  (players talk)
  •  Choice        (rolls or arguments)
  •  Consequence   (ref narrates)
  •  Quiet moment  (map editing, notes)
  •  New hook      (mm-note, new direction)

Mark each beat in log.txt with an mm-note line; this makes the session
readable later.

Narration
----------
Describe with the senses, not stats.
Say what the characters *see, hear, and feel* before mentioning dice.

Example:
  “The reliquary rattles, as though something inside it breathes.”
  (pause)
  “Make a Fear save—mm-save FD +0 1”

Log Discipline
--------------
Referees should:
  •  Start each scene with mm-note “Scene: Cathedral crypt”
  •  Use mm-note for NPC lines not spoken by a player.
  •  Keep all rolls public.
  •  Review rng.log occasionally; it proves honesty.

Advancement
-----------
After 3 sessions, reward growth:
  •  +1 to one ability modifier
  •  or learn a new skill at 6+
  •  or gain a special item, contact, or scar.

Encourage epilogues.  Characters evolve through narrative, not points.

Improvising NPCs
----------------
When you need one fast:
  1.  Roll a trait on d6 twice (personality + quirk)
          1 Curious   2 Bitter   3 Pious   4 Drunk   5 Kind   6 Cunning
          1 Limp      2 Scar     3 Shakes  4 Squints 5 Laughs 6 Silent
  2.  Give them one motive.
  3.  Record in gm.log:
          NPC: Brother Alois (Cunning, Laughs) — wants relic for himself.

Keep them human.  Even monsters have reasons.

Referee’s tmux Layout (optional)
--------------------------------
mm-tmux-ref <campaign>
  pane 1: shell
  pane 2: log tail
  pane 3: gm.log tail
  pane 4: live map view
windows: maps / gm / rng
Exit with  Ctrl-b d.

Maintenance & Backups
---------------------
At end of night:
  tar czf ../sessions/$(date +%F).tgz .
  chmod a-w log.txt
  cp gm.log gm/backup-$(date +%F).txt  (optional)
If hosting over telnet, rotate sessions weekly.

Custom Content
---------------
You can expand the world infinitely by editing text:
  lib/tables/   → random events and treasures
  lib/maps/     → dungeons, cities
  pcs/ & npcs/  → stat blocks
  stash/        → letters, relics, clues
Try to stay within human-readable conventions: TSV, YAML-like lists, etc.

Mindset
-------
You are not simulating reality; you are facilitating belief.

Fair rulings.  Shared wonder.  No secrets the shell cannot show.
