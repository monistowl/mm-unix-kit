Materia Mundi — Session Zero
============================

PURPOSE
-------
This document exists to help a new group align expectations before the
first real session.  Read it aloud together, or have everyone skim it
before rolling any dice.

Materia Mundi is built around imagination, respect, and judgment.
There are no hidden rule engines—only human rulings and shared notes.

Tone & Genre
------------
Low fantasy verging on historical:
•  1430s Flanders, on the edge of war and wonder.
•  Magic is rare, expensive, and often theological.
•  Miracles, alchemy, relics, and saints all draw from the same pool of power.
•  Violence is quick, dirty, and consequential.
•  Beauty coexists with plague, poverty, and devotion.

Expect moral ambiguity, small victories, and the slow unveiling of a
world that wants to test what you believe in.

Boundaries & Safety
-------------------
Talk before you play.  Everyone has the right to a good time.

•  The "X" rule: any player may type  mm-say "X"  to skip a scene or topic.
   The ref will fade to black and move on.  No explanation required.
•  The "Pause" rule:  mm-say "Pause"  to clarify tone, intensity, or consent.
•  Keep violence and horror descriptive, not voyeuristic.
•  Romance is optional; consent is absolute.
•  Everyone can leave the session directory any time—real life comes first.

If you are remote: agree on when logs will be pruned or archived.
No one should feel watched forever.

Group Roles
------------
Referee (GM):  describes the world, plays its inhabitants, decides outcomes.
Players:  describe their characters’ actions and intentions.

The referee is *not* an opponent; think of them as the camera operator.

Goals of Play
-------------
1.  To explore and survive in a living world.
2.  To interpret what "Materia"—the stuff of creation—means.
3.  To build legends out of ordinary choices.
4.  To make a story you’d want to read later in log.txt.

Practical Setup
---------------
•  Everyone logged into the same host, ideally in the same UNIX group.
•  Referee starts session:
       mm-session start Antwerp-HYW 1
       export MM_SESSION=.../sessions/1991-12-25_1
•  Players join:
       mm-session join Antwerp-HYW recent
       export MM_SESSION=.../sessions/1991-12-25_1
•  Optional: start tmux layouts (mm-tmux-ref / mm-tmux-player)
•  Each player creates a character:
       mm-char Antwerp-HYW new "Your Name"
       mm-char Antwerp-HYW edit Your_Name.mm

Starter Scenario: “Ashes at the Cathedral Gate”
-----------------------------------------------
Setting:  Antwerp, spring of 1432.  The plague banners are down but the
bells still toll for debtors.  The bishop’s almoner seeks mercenaries to
escort a reliquary from a burned village back to the cathedral.

Hook:  You’ve been promised a silver coin each and safe lodging.
The reliquary may—or may not—contain the skull of a child saint.

Act I:  Street of the Chandlers
    •  Smoke still rises from a block of ruined shops.
    •  A crowd gathers around a blind monk muttering prophecies.
    •  The reliquary is in the sacristy, guarded by one nervous cleric.
    •  Strange lights were seen above the river last night.

Scenes to try:
    •  Negotiate with the almoner (Charm or Leadership)
    •  Search the ruins (Perception or Survival)
    •  Pray at the broken font (Wit or Faith)
    •  Confront a starving wolf-hound that has followed the scent of ashes.

Act II:  The River Road
    •  A sudden storm, overturned cart, and the reliquary gone missing.
    •  Follow tracks into the marsh (Survival)
    •  Confront bandits or something worse (Initiative, Melee)
    •  Recover or destroy the relic; each choice changes your fate.

End of Session:  everyone writes a one-sentence epilogue in log.txt:
    mm-say "Epilogue — Joan carries the relic in silence."

Level Up
--------
If a character survives three sessions and contributes to the story,
they may increase one ability modifier by +1 or learn a new skill at 6+.
XP exists only as a shorthand for experience shared in logs.

Etiquette
---------
•  Announce actions clearly:  mm-say "I check the door for traps."
•  Let the ref set difficulties.
•  Keep rolls visible; honesty is the heart of the system.
•  Respect the text:  everyone can read the same files.

Inspirations
------------
The Name of the Rose,  A Canticle for Leibowitz,  Tarkovsky’s Stalker,
the Ars Goetia,  early D&D’s wilderness tables, and real medieval alchemy.

Remember:  The world is a conversation between matter and meaning.
Your words, typed into this terminal, make it real.
